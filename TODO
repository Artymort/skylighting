_ test against h-k for correctness
  _ life.lua
  for:
    -- local i=os.clock()+1 while(os.clock()<i) do end
  end
  we get:
  , [ ( NormalTok , "  " )
    , ( DocumentationTok , "-- local i=os.clock()+1 while(os.clock()" )
    , ( KeywordTok , "<i" )
    , ( OtherTok , ") do end" )
    ]
  , [ ( DocumentationTok , "end" ) ]

  Partly this is a bug in kate, which also highlights the doc line
  as above. however, kate correctly formats th final 'end'.

  ok, looks like this is a matter of applying the lineEndContext
  shift in the included context (doxygenlua); so maybe we should check for
  line-end after applying a rule?
  the keyword tag is because lua likes to highlight HTML in doxygen.

_ handle lineEmptyContext

_ make insensitive attribute work with StringDetect

_ set column = 0 for regexes starting with ^

_ separate out tokenizer/formatter tests
  tokenizer tests should go to native rather than HTML

_ add a separate formatter test (for both html and latex)

_ fix FromJSON instance for Style, Color, and
  add a function to read a KDE theme as a style
  (also add the standard ones to the library)

_ make faster
  _ can we compile some modules with optimizations, others without?
  _ benchmark and profile
  _ use Text instead of String
  _ use Set for Char matchers (parameterize WordSet?)
  _ improve normalize fn?
  _ avoid creating empty tokens?

_ proper haddock documentation

_ proper README.md

_ proper tests
