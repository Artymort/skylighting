_ make faster
  _ benchmark and profile
    (profiling shows a lot of time spent in UTF-8 decoding,
     in utf8-string -- using text might help?)
  _ use Text instead of String
  _ use Set for Char matchers (parameterize WordSet?)
  _ improve normalize fn?

_ proper haddock documentation

_ proper README.md

_ proper tests
