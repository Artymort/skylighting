_ use full name for the syntax map not shortName,
  or includerules will fail - eg CMake Cmake
_ Complete: don't use syntaxMap directly
  a syntax map should be a parameter of the tokenize function.
_ Instead of highlightAs, we should simply provide a function
  that retrieves the Syntax given various sorts of names.
  And we don't need to provide all the same fns as in
  h-k.
_ handle dynamic in Parser, Tokenizer
  this attribute attaches to: context, RegExpr
  figure out what it does on each and look at examples
_ test against h-k for correctness
_ handle case sensitive rule attribute in tokenizer
_ better exception handling in Parser
_ better exception handling in Tokenizer
_ make faster
  (use Set for char and keyword matchers)
  (improve normalize fn?)
_ proper haddock documentation
_ proper README.md
_ proper tests
