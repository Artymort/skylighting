_ separate out tokenizer/formatter tests
  tokenizer tests should go to native rather than HTML

_ for startingContext, store a name; otherwise we have big
  code duplicaiton. then do a name lookup.

_ handle lineEmptyContext

_ make insensitive attribute work with StringDetect

_ set column = 0 for regexes starting with ^

_ add a separate formatter test (for both html and latex)

_ fix FromJSON instance for Style, Color, and
  add a function to read a KDE theme as a style
  (also add the standard ones to the library)

_ make faster
  _ can we compile some modules with optimizations, others without?
  _ benchmark and profile
  _ use Text instead of String
  _ use Set for Char matchers (parameterize WordSet?)
  _ improve normalize fn?
  _ avoid creating empty tokens?

_ proper haddock documentation

_ proper README.md

_ proper tests
