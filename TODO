_ don't use syntaxMap directly; instead, put the map in
  state and provide a way for it to be modified so people
  can add their own syntax definitions (or modify existing
  ones); a syntax map should be a parameter of the
  tokenize function.
_ handle dynamic in Parser, Tokenizer
  this attribute attaches to: context, RegExpr
  figure out what it does on each and look at examples
_ test against h-k for correctness
_ handle case sensitive rule attribute in tokenizer
_ better exception handling in Parser
_ better exception handling in Tokenizer
_ make faster
  (use Set for char and keyword matchers)
  (improve normalize fn?)
_ proper haddock documentation
_ proper README.md
_ proper tests
